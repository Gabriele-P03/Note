# A To-Do Android Application

 * To add a new note, click on "New Note" showed on the menu

 * Notes are showed onto a list view organized by time:
   The first one is the next you have to do
 
 
 * Notice that notification and note is created every time you
   click on "Save Note", so even if you delete it from
   the list view, the notification will be NOT eliminated!
 
 
 * Note is saved on a text file called as "DD-MM-YY@HH:MM",
   so you can create only one note at a given date and time.
 
 * If you create twice, the last one will only be considered.
   Notice that, as said above, notification is set every time you
   create a new note and cannot be deleted, so you will receive
   notification about both
 
 * Why I chose to not allow deleting notification via button click?
   'Cause when the notification is pushed, maybe you cannot look at
   the phone, so you gonna do it later
   
 * Still no settings available.
