# Note
# A To-Do Android Application

 * These ones are showed onto a list view organized by time:
 * The first one is the next you have to do
 *
 *
 * To add a new note, click on "Add Note" on the popup window.
 *
 * Notice that notification and note is created every time you
 * click on "Save Note", so even if you delete it from
 * the list view, the notification will be NOT eliminated and you
 * will received it the same!
 *
 *
 * Note are saved on a text file called as "DD-MM-YY@HH:MM",
 * so you can create only one note at a given date and time.
 *
 * If you create twice, the last one will only be considered.
 * Notice that, as said above, notification is set every time you
 * create a new note and cannot be deleted, so you will receive
 * notification about both
 *
 * Why I chose to not allow deleting notification via button click?
 * 'Cause when the notification is pushed, maybe you cannot look at
 * the phone, so you gonna do it later
